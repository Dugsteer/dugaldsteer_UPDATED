        <h1>Web Design</h1>
        <p>Dugald Steer always harbored a desire to learn programming, and during the pandemic lockdown, he took the
            opportunity to dive into web development. He taught himself how to code websites using HTML, CSS, SASS,
            JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Dugald created this website and the chatbot that lives on it, along with others
            like his teaching and English language sites. Excited about the possibilities of AI, he appreciates how GPT
            models like Grimoire can serve as handy assistants. However, he remains amused by their quirks—such as
            DALL·E's inability to draw an English teacher without a beard or how Grimoire can be brilliant one moment
            and overlook basic details like API keys the next. To navigate programming challenges and avoid getting lost
            in "rabbit holes" where everything stops working, he finds GitHub (https://github.com/Dugsteer) to be an
            invaluable resource.</p>
